## These functions are attempt to cache the inverse of a matrix in order to
## reduce the repeatly calculation of inversing.

## "makeCacheMatrix()" is a function that creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve<- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## "cacheSolve()" is a function that computes the inverse of the special 
## "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve 
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
